## About
This project looks at three different sets of data to answer the following questions:
 1. What is the spending amount compared to the age of the shopper? *BlackFriday dataset*
 2. How do the goals for and against compare within the wins/losses? *TeamsPost dataset*
 3. What is the biggest factor within each age group? *Heart dataset*
 
## File Information
R Markdown Code: "Final_MosesKrystina.Rmd"

## Results
1. None of the age groups had a higher spending than the others. The average purchases total was $9333.86 with less from age group of 55+.

2. The average goals for and goals against was calculated to 25.6. I found that in the year 1918, the total number of games as 5 and when there were 4 wins vs 1 loss, there was a higher goals for amount than against. When sorting the data from highest amount of goals for, it is shown that this was in the year of 1984; however, the big difference is the number of games played at 18 vs the data before at 5. 

3. The average cholesterol was given at 246.3, the average age of heart attack was given at 54, the avereage resting blood pressure was 131.6 and the average maximum heart rate schieved was 149.65.
